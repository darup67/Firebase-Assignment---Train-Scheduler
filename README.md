# Overview

# Train Scheduler :train2: :heavy_check_mark: :clock9:



This is a train schedule application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data for trains. First, you schedule a train by entering relevant information about when it is first scheduled and how often it runs. Then, the app shows the schedule of all the trains and when the next arrival time is and how many minutes until it arrives.

When adding trains, you provide the following:

Train Name

Destination

First Train Time -- in military time

Frequency -- in minutes

- The app calculates when the next train will arrive based on current time and frequency

- The app updates the train arrivals (next time and minutes away) every minute to keep the times up to the minute on the web page.
